0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

Description
This project explores the concept of asynchronous comprehensions in Python. Asynchronous comprehensions allow for the creation of asynchronous generators, enabling the asynchronous iteration over sequences and the asynchronous creation of sequences.

In this project you are required to understand the following:

How to write an asynchronous generator

How to use async comprehensions

How to type-annotate generators
